# AI-as-a-tool-for-Missing-Persons-Identification

In India, almost 500 missing person cases go unresolved daily. Finding a missing person these days is a challenging task; even if social media keeps us all informed, it still requires a lot of paperwork, takes a long time, and provides little promise that the search will be successful. This project implements a system to streamline facial recognition searches for the benefit of both the public and the police authority. The problem is solved by utilizing a deep learning concept to arrive at an effective solution. Individuals are detected using a convolutional neural network (CNN). Several characteristics of the face are used to positively identify the missing person. The backend processes the image of the missing person, and essential information is stored. Additional information, such as name, parent's name, age, location, and so on, is stored in a database along with this. If the user believes a person's photo is suspicious, they can upload it using this program. We saved this photograph in the database. The GUI application uses a machine learning algorithm to compare user-submitted photographs to those uploaded by the admin. If a match is found, we will present it, along with the details of the last known location of the missing person.

# Objective
The main aim this project is to make easy way to track missing people by Police and top Officials. In subsequent events, the normal thing to follow someone is with an investigation that would take some time and experience to track proper questions. But many a times this method works but it is time taking as well as does not work if the person, has been moved to a place (any city/country)

So, in this types of conditions, the best way is to look CCTV footage and proofs. This is another aspect of the file process that can take a lot of time, not to mention the fact that with the thousands going missing each day, it can be a little hard to keep up with it all.
