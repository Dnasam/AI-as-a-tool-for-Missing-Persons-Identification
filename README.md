# AI-as-a-tool-for-Missing-Persons-Identification

In India, almost 500 missing person cases go unresolved daily. Finding a missing person these days is a challenging task; even if social media keeps us all informed, it still requires a lot of paperwork, takes a long time, and provides little promise that the search will be successful. This project implements a system to streamline facial recognition searches for the benefit of both the public and the police authority. The problem is solved by utilizing a deep learning concept to arrive at an effective solution. Individuals are detected using a convolutional neural network (CNN). Several characteristics of the face are used to positively identify the missing person. The backend processes the image of the missing person, and essential information is stored. Additional information, such as name, parent's name, age, location, and so on, is stored in a database along with this. If the user believes a person's photo is suspicious, they can upload it using this program. We saved this photograph in the database. The GUI application uses a machine learning algorithm to compare user-submitted photographs to those uploaded by the admin. If a match is found, we will present it, along with the details of the last known location of the missing person.
